However, when the random variables are highly positively correlated, the sample sizes needed for estimating extreme quantiles become computationally unmanageable. This paper gives a practical scheme, based on a maximum transformation in a two-way layout of the data, that reduces the sample size sufficiently to allow an experimenter to obtain a point estimate of an extreme quantile. The paper gives three schemes that lead to confidence interval estimates for the quantile. One uses a spectral analysis of the reduced sample. The other two, averaged group quantiles and nested group quantiles, are extensions of the method of batched means to quantile estimation. These two schemes give even greater data compaction than the first scheme. None of the schemes requires that the process being simulated is regenerative.},

  abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 {$\leq$} t\textsubscript{1}' {$\leq$} t\textsubscript{2}' {$\leq$} {$\cdots$} {$\leq$} t\textsubscript{N}'. Then {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}hat\{P\}(t) = \textbackslash prod\_r \textbackslash lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1)\textbackslash rbrack\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$}, where r assumes those values for which t\textsubscript{r}' {$\leq$} t and for which t\textsubscript{r}' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

This study used spatial road data from Norway followed by integrating temporal-spatial and statistical analyses to show a potential approach to estimate the lifetimes of asphalt surfacing. For the statistical part, a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was used to understand the relationship between longevity of surface mixtures and different factors, while avoiding having predefined assumptions rooted in deterministic modeling. In addition, rutting was used as the response variable to determine distress-specific asphalt surfacing lifetimes and to handle censored data. Inclusion of rutting as the response variable showed that the median technical lifetime of asphalt surfacing is about 2 years shorter than that of the maintenance activity records. The results showed the significance of each covariate; however, aggregate nominal maximum size and heavy traffic volume were consistently the significant covariates across the studied traffic classes. In addition, the results were fitted to reference categories in each covariate to show a practical approach to interpret absolute values of lifetimes from a survival table.

When the normality assumption is violated, interpretation and inferences may not be reliable or valid. The three common procedures in assessing whether a random sample of independent observations of size n come from a population with a normal distribution are: graphical methods (histograms, boxplots, Q-Q-plots), numerical methods (skewness and kurtosis indices) and formal normality tests. This paper* compares the power of four formal tests of normality: Shapiro-Wilk (SW) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Lilliefors (LF) test and Anderson-Darling (AD) test. Power comparisons of these four tests were obtained via Monte Carlo simulation of sample data generated from alternative distributions that follow symmetric and asymmetric distributions. Ten thousand samples of various sample size were generated from each of the given alternative symmetric and asymmetric distributions. The power of each test was then obtained by comparing the test of normality statistics with the respective critical values. Results show that Shapiro-Wilk test is the most powerful normality test, followed by Anderson-Darling test, Lilliefors test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, the power of all four tests is still low for small sample size.},

A key advantage of the approach is that it facilitates efficient estimation of smoothing parameters as an integral part of model estimation, via GCV or AIC, and numerically robust algorithms for this are presented. We also derive simulation free approximate Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth components, which are shown to achieve close to nominal coverage probabilities. Applications are presented using real data examples including the risk of disease in relation to proximity to municipal incinerators and the association between air pollution and health.},

  abstract = {Scientists and others today often collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data. Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors' own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

  abstract = {De maatgevende schadesoort bij ZOAB-deklagen is rafeling. Rafeling ontstaat vooral door de verkeersbelasting en in beperkte mate ook door omgevingsinvloeden zoals regen, vervuiling en kadavers. De verkeersbelasting op de rechterrijstrook is zwaarder dan op de overige stroken. Dit heeft tot gevolg dat in veel gevallen de schade(rafeling) eerder de onderhoudsnorm bereikt en dat dan een strookbrede deklaagvervanging op de rechterrijstrook moet worden uitgevoerd. De kwaliteit van de ZOAB-deklaag op de inhaalstroken is op dat moment meestal nog zodanig, dat een baanbrede vervanging van de deklaag niet nodig is. In een later stadium zal een baanbrede deklaagvervanging aan de orde zijn. Met een strookbrede deklaagvervanging ontstaan inhomogeniteiten in de verhardingsconstructie (langs- en dwarslassen). Deze inhomogeniteiten hebben mogelijk invloed op de ontwikkeling van rafeling op zowel de aanliggende inhaalstrook als ook de uit/in-reparatie zelf. Ook de uitvoering (frezen, aanbrengen, walsen etc.) kan van invloed zijn op de kwaliteit van de inhaalstrook. Het gevolg van e.e.a. is dat de planjaren voor rafeling op de aanliggende inhaalstrook voor en na de strookbrede maatregel mogelijk verschillen. Ook de levensduur van de inlaag zelf kan mogelijk verschillen van de initi\"ele levensduur van ZOAB.},

It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course, including likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures, the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},
