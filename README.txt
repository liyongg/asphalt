MSc Thesis: Progression of Aggregate Loss on Porous Asphalt
Author: Li Yong Pan

The scripts 'Functions.R, Create_Weg.R, Anomalies_List.R, Status_List.R' contain functions and lists of which I have tried to elaborate on what exactly they do.
Due to time constraints, I could not keep up with proper documentation and comments on every single function.
The script 'MSc Thesis.R' contains commands that can be run in order to produce the same plots as in the thesis.
